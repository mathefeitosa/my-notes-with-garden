First declension nouns are (generally) feminine nouns ending in -a in the nominative case. Examples are femina and puella.

Second declension nouns are (generally) masculine nouns ending in -us and (generally) neuter nouns ending in -um in the nominative case. Examples are the names Stephanus and Marcus. Vir and puer are masculine nouns that follow the second declension as well.

This course uses Classical Pronunciation. A few things worth noting:

V sounds like the English W
C always sounds like a K
G is always hard and never J
AE sounds like the English word "eye"
